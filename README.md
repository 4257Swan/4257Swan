👋 Hi, I’m @4257Swan

👀 I’m interested in coding in general, with a strong passion for back-end development.

🌱 I’m currently studying computer science, delving into cybersecurity and intelligent algorithms. I’m always curious and eager to explore anything that piques my interest.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge my skills and push the boundaries of what’s possible, particularly in areas like game development, cybersecurity, or LLMs.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to reach out via GitHub or email me at 4257Swan@proton.me.

⚡ Fun fact: My ultimate goal is to develop my own operating system someday.
